# Medigamer

When running this project, make sure to have at least your head, shoulders, and arms in frame.

For the best accuracy, place the camera a few feet away from you, directly facing one of your sides (your mousehand side is recommended).

If there is no image displaying and ther is just a static black screen in the window, "Mediapipe Feed", change the number in cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) from 0 to 1 or 2. OpenCV needs to know what camera your computer is using.
